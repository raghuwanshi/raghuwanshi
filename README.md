- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @raghuwanshi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything which I feel important but no one else is working on.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go programing language. But my learning style is a spiral, so many things (Ex. New versions or C++ or C#) keep revolving around.

If you are not reading this on my profile but in the repository, then this is my home repository having a backup of my common settings and scripts that I use with Git command prompt or otherwise. 

âœ¨ You may use them with little modification âœ¨.
